## Matplotlib and pyplot

### Student Name: Naiema Elsaadi

The exercise is focused on exploring various Python concepts, including data structures, algorithms, data analysis, and visualization. It includes Jupyter Notebooks covering topics such as sorting algorithms, data manipulation, statistical analysis, machine learning, and natural language processing. The notebooks contain code examples, explanations, and visualizations to help users understand and learn these concepts. Additionally, the project aims to provide a hands-on learning experience for Python enthusiasts of all levels, from beginners to advanced users.

## Introduction

This exercise is designed to reinforce key Python visualization skills, particularly using the Matplotlib library. Matplotlib is a powerful library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. We'll primarily focus on using the pyplot module, which provides a simple interface for building charts.


## Task Breakdown:
1. Task 1: Get Started
- Copy the base repository to your GitHub account.
- Clone your repository to your local machine.
2. Task 2: Open Notebook and Complete Tasks
- Add a clickable link to your GitHub repo in the Markdown introduction.
- Use Markdown headings for each question number.
- Complete the provided tasks in the Jupyter notebooks.
- Execute the notebooks, commit, and push changes to GitHub.
3. Task 3: Export to HTML and Finalize Repo
- Execute each notebook.
- Export each notebook to HTML format.
- Commit and push the HTML files along with the executed notebooks.



## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Git
- Github
- Python 3.10+ installed
- VS studio Code
- juypterlab
- anaconda prompt (miniconda3) or windows PowerShell
- Required Python libraries (e.g., numpy) installed in your active environment

## Getting Started

- Before we begin, make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed in your Python environment. If you haven't already, you'll need to install Matplotlib using the following command:
` pip install matplotlib`
- install it into our active virtual environment and
- use an import statement in our Python. 
- Spelling and capitalization matters - to use a library, you might need to first search for the install commands and then find the typical way it is imported into Python. 
- The typical approach is to:
1. Create a virtual environment
2. Activate the virtual environment
3. Install into the active virtual environment (e.g. `python -m pip install matplotlib`)
4. In your Python, import it (e.g. `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`)

## How to Run

<b><br> Follow these steps to run the project:  </b></br>

1. Get the starter repo into your GitHub account.
- The video uses GitHub classroom, some sections will just start with a template (like forking, but disconnects from the original starter repo). 
2. Clone down your repo to your local machine,
3. Start up Jupyter lab (or Jupyter Notebook),
4. Make edits to Markdown cells and Python code cells
5. Add and commit your changes using Git
6. Push your commit up to the GitHub repo.
7. Export your notebook as HTML (a web page) for submission using the menu


## Installation

Instructions for installing any dependencies or software needed to run the project. Include commands for installing packages or setting up environments.

To use the notebooks in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/NaiemaElsaadi/pyplot.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd pyplot
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
python -m venv venv
4. Activate the virtual environment:
 For Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
5. Install the required packages:  
pip install -r requirements.txt
6. Launch Jupyter Lab:
jupyter lab
7. Open the desired notebook and execute the code cells.


## Usage
